# Bitcoin

First of all, I started my project as a spring boot project. In this project I tried to get input data from binance.com. Then I installed the build as MVC. First I wrote the data from binance.com into the folder and then I sent my data in the folder to the database. By the way, I chose to use MySql for the database. Finally, I displayed my data from database to client.(You will see 3 different attempts in this repo.)
